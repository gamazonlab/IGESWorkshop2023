## Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data  

### Abstract

Single-cell technologies are transforming our understanding of complex biological systems and enabling key insights into molecular mechanisms of disease. Recent years have witnessed the rapid accumulation of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets in a wide range of applications. This workshop will provide a practical introduction to the analysis of scRNA-seq data and the diversity of existing computational tools. Topics will include quality control, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, RNA velocity, and differential expression analysis. Finally, we will explore integrative approaches linking scRNA-seq and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data to investigate disease mechanisms.

Workshop participants will have a working knowledge of R and must have RStudio and the Seurat library installed.
