# Tutorial workshop goals:

The following tutorial is designed to give an overview of single cell sequencing data analyses using the Seurat software procedure. 
Here, we address three main goals:

  - Identify cell types markers and clusters 
  - Compare the datasets to find cell-type and condition specific gene signatures
