The data that is used for workshop purpose is downloaded from the paper "A molecular single-cell lung atlas of lethal COVID-19".

The original dataset consists scRNAseq collected from fatal covid cases (n=19) and controls (n=7).
For the purpose of this workshop, the dataset has been subsetted to 3 samples that were randomly selected for each condition (covid & normal).The donor IDs for the selected controls are : C51ctr and C53ctr. 
The donorIDs for the covid cases are L11cov, L22cov and L07cov.

In the data folder, please find the following datasets that are needed for the workshop. 

"control.count.matrices.txt.tar.gz" --> the raw count matrices for the  control samples

"cases.count.matrices.txt.tar.gz" --> the raw count matrices for the covid case samples

"meta_data_covid.txt" --> meta data for both the covid and control samples
