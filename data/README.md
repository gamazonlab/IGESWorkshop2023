# README

The data used in the workshop can be downloaded from the paper "A molecular single-cell lung atlas of lethal COVID-19". 

Here is a link to the paper ðŸ‘‰ https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03569-1

Here is a link to the individual level matrices ðŸ‘‰ https://data.humancellatlas.org/explore/projects/d7845650-f6b1-4b1c-b2fe-c0795416ba7b/project-matrices

The original dataset consists scRNAseq collected from fatal COVID-19 cases (n=19) and controls (n=7). For the purpose of this workshop, the dataset has been subsetted to 3 samples that were randomly selected for each condition (COVID-19 & control).
The donor IDs for the selected controls are : C51ctr and C53ctr. 
The donorIDs for the covid cases are L11cov, L22cov and L07cov.

In the data folder of this repository, please find the following datasets that are needed for the workshop. 

"control.count.matrices.txt.tar.gz" --> the raw count matrices for the control samples

"cases.count.matrices.txt.tar.gz" --> the raw count matrices for the COVID-19 case samples

"meta_data_covid.txt" --> metadata for both the COVID-19 and control samples
