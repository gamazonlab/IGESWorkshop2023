# Tutorial workshop goals:

The following tutorial is designed to give an overview of data analyses using single cell sequencing datasets using the Seurat procedure. Here, we address three main goals:

- Perform QC analysis as well as dimensionality reduction
- Identify cell types markers and cell type clusters that are present in both datasets
- Compare the datasets to find cell-type and condition specific signatures
