The data that is used for workshop purpose is downloaded from the paper "A molecular single-cell lung atlas of lethal COVID-19". The link to the paper is ðŸ‘‰ https://data.humancellatlas.org/explore/projects/d7845650-f6b1-4b1c-b2fe-c0795416ba7b/project-matrices

The original dataset consists scRNAseq collected from fatal covid cases (n=19) and controls (n=7).
For the purpose of this workshop, the dataset have been subsetted to 3 samples that were randomly selected for each condition (covid & normal).The donor IDs for the selected controls are : C51ctr , C53ctr and C56ctr. 
The donorIDs for the covid cases are L11cov, L22cov and L07cov.
